		<h1>Oxygen Rate</h1>
		<p>Oxygen rate is a measure of the amount of oxygen in your blood. It is an important indicator of your respiratory health. A normal oxygen saturation level for adults is between 95-100%, but this can vary depending on age, health, and other factors.</p>
		
		<h2>Measuring Oxygen Rate</h2>
		<p>Oxygen rate can be measured using a pulse oximeter, which is a small device that clips onto your finger. The pulse oximeter measures the amount of oxygen in your blood by passing a light through your finger and measuring the light absorption. The result is displayed as a percentage of oxygen saturation.</p>
		
		<h2>Safe Oxygen Rate Range</h2>
		<p>A normal oxygen saturation level for adults is between 95-100%. If your oxygen saturation level falls below 90%, you may require supplemental oxygen. However, this can vary depending on your health and other factors. If you are unsure about your oxygen saturation level, consult with your doctor.</p>
