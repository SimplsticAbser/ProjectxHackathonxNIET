		<h1>Glucose Level</h1>
		<p>Glucose level is a measure of the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood. It is an important indicator of your metabolic health. A normal glucose level for adults who have fasted for 8 hours is between 70-99 mg/dL, but this can vary depending on age, health, and other factors.</p>
		
		<h2>Measuring Glucose Level</h2>
		<p>Glucose level can be measured using a blood glucose meter, which is a small device that pricks your finger to obtain a small sample of blood. The blood glucose meter then measures the glucose level in the sample and displays the result in mg/dL or mmol/L.</p>
		
		<h2>Safe Glucose Level Range</h2>
		<p>A normal glucose level for adults who have fasted for 8 hours is between 70-99 mg/dL. If your glucose level falls below 70 mg/dL, you may have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which can cause symptoms such as shakiness, dizziness, and confusion. If your glucose level is consistently high, you may have hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), which can cause long-term health problems such as heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage.</p>
