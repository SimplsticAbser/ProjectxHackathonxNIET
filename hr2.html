		<h1>Heart Rate</h1>
		<p>Heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute. It is an important indicator of your cardiovascular health. A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, but this can vary depending on age, fitness level, and other factors.</p>
		
		<h2>Measuring Heart Rate</h2>
		<p>Heart rate can be measured in several ways, including by taking your pulse, using a heart rate monitor, or through an electrocardiogram (ECG) test. The most common method is taking your pulse, which can be done by placing your index and middle fingers on your wrist or neck and counting the number of beats you feel in 15 seconds. You can then multiply this number by 4 to get your heart rate in beats per minute.</p>
		
		<h2>Safe Heart Rate Range</h2>
		<p>The American Heart Association recommends a target heart rate zone for exercise, which is generally between 50-85% of your maximum heart rate. To calculate your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, if you are 30 years old, your maximum heart rate would be 190 (220 - 30). To calculate your target heart rate zone, multiply your maximum heart rate by 0.5 and 0.85. Using the same example, your target heart rate zone would be between 95 (190 x 0.5) and 162 (190 x 0.85) beats per minute.</p>

		<p>It is important to note that if you are experiencing heart problems or have been diagnosed with a heart condition, you should consult with your doctor before engaging in any exercise or taking any medication. Your doctor may prescribe medication or recommend a specific exercise program to help you maintain a healthy heart.</p>
