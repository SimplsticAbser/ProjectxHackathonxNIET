		<h1>Body Temperature Level</h1>
		<p>Body temperature is a measure of the heat produced by your body. The normal range for body temperature is between 97.8°F (36.5°C) and 99°F (37.2°C), but this can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, time of day, and physical activity.</p>
		
		<h2>Measuring Body Temperature</h2>
		<p>Body temperature can be measured in several ways, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Oral thermometer: This is the most common way to measure body temperature. The thermometer is placed under the tongue and the temperature is taken.</li>
			<li>Ear thermometer: This is a quick and easy way to measure body temperature. The thermometer is placed in the ear canal and the temperature is taken.</li>
			<li>Forehead thermometer: This is a non-invasive way to measure body temperature. The thermometer is placed on the forehead and the temperature is taken.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Safe Body Temperature Range</h2>
		<p>The normal range for body temperature is between 97.8°F (36.5°C) and 99°F (37.2°C). If your body temperature falls below this range, you may have hypothermia (low body temperature), which can cause symptoms such as shivering, confusion, and dizziness. If your body temperature is consistently high, you may have hyperthermia (high body temperature), which can cause long-term health problems such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and dehydration.</p>
